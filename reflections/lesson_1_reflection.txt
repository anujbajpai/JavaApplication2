How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

  Becoase I see ONLY lines that deffer in old and new files, so I need only check out lines in new file. not throu whole new file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    it saves time. It is graeat to have all versions of a file, and having posibilty to go back to any of them when needed and see any changes that were made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros I can choose to coommit onece per logical change
    cons I can forget to commit in time, and git diff will show a big difference in code

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Becouse Git is more code oriented and Google Docs is general, more documents orinented

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log    shows all commits that had been made. git diff shows difference between two commits: added and delited lines

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Can use "git checkout IDofCommmit" to get back to any previose commmit  

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
